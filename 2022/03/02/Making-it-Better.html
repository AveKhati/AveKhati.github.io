				  <div class="main-component-item"><p>It has been such a recurring recognition in my thoughts, that for the time being this is all that my little blog here might be contrinuted to dealing with: taming thoughts, and finding the right personalized approach to deal with the fatigue and toils of the mind, which likes to hector and scream at itself for some reason that diverges from rationality. Essentially, maturity is all about keeping sane, but to a level that's more consistent and informed than what's observed in one's younger years. Strictly speaking, this blog is not a form of personal development, it is rather a documentation of how I have matured across time, what steps I took, and what the consequence of my actions were against the greater whole. The reason why a matured figure is depicted as 'sapped' serves as a basis for this characterization: if impulsivity is mainly gated by excessive energy, then reducing overall activity (say, by making one feel fatigued) will produce symptomology of an advancing stage of maturity. The less desired effect of curtailing impulsive patterns is plainly obvious for those who have ever felt sedated before. Considering action before committing it likely comes with a very slight, haggard sensation of acceptance. Being unaware or unaffected by the situation at hand may leverage time to make more informed decisions throughout the day, but that comes with its own loss. In my thoughts I detailed a single form of 'matured' figure, who has entrenched himself into a vastly dull and sedated state to get through the day. His demeanor shows some impotence which he chooses not to address for his own reasons, and his understanding of the world presents him as of cynical and misanthropic in an unrelatable, unpitable way. His style in which he chose to live was his own decision, and followed a previous lifestyle of dissolution which he narrowly escaped to live a life that he hadn't fully invisioned in entirety before seeking growth and departure from this former unwise and misguided way of life. He did his best to tune out what the world was trying to offer him, which was little at all, and because of the lies that others had led him with, he promised himself he was never going to act out again in a fit of craving and instead worked to achieve a complete suppresion of thoughts that commonly took him astray and diverted him away from the path that he was destined for. Regarding his thoughts as mostly habituated, and realizing that he only had so much time before he had to specialize in the world, he urgently needed a solution that he could practice for the remainder of his time of ambitious youth... before his skin peeled and his eyes strained by having to show to a confined cubicle on a daily basis to provide susteninance for himself (since at this time, he met no desire to find a significant other, being as though people to him were mechanical ragdolls who never changed unless by an extreme impulse or intervention of some sort). He was numbed, but also quite determined in leaving behind the hurricane of lies that conditioned him badly at childhood.</p>

<p> It wasn't until much later in his life that he became firm in his convictions of how people responded and behaved in their envirnoment, and that he could do little to inform them since most people had a type of penchant or presumed fondness for taking offense at the existence of others' views which had conflicted with their own. There was nothing wrong, he figured, with being this obstinant or intolerant to different viewpoints, sinc ehe noticed that pattern to do so even within himself, and began to believe it was a product of nature. However, he came to see the abuses that others' had endured, and their nonchalance to all of this made him furious of the world he was put into without his hearing. He tried to enjoy much of life as possible, without thinking too much about hte responsibilites which had limited his mind more than it did service it. (It's easy to think this way if an individual is not seeing him or herself growing into a developing figure, or the values that this individual brings to define and clarify the sequences of life are disorganized and/or are not fully alligned with the work that is being done.) At any given moment in time, this individual was finding himself doing things that he knew he would berate himself for doing later down the line. Wasting massive hours on the internet, lying around and thinking about an incident from his childhood that had no significance in the now, or, perhaps more frequently, a fragment of dialogue from a converastion that he found himself unwittingly a prat of during the earlier happenings of the day. For him, it was incredibly difficult to focus on the present, and knowing the nature of his thoughts which had duped his own into stunting his individual improvement over a larger stretch of the term. After much thought, he realized he needed to structure and make habitual a pattern of thinking from which he could, at any moment, return to for the sake of eluding his impulsivity. There were other behavior practices as well, he realized, that may lessen his daily stresses which may succor in a greater attachment to the present. Ensuring adequate sleep hours and cycling, he noted, was a glaringly obvious course he could partake to at least make living a little more bearable, even if it could not yield anything to his overall performance. And this was it, really. It was all he ever thought he needed, just the feeling of security rather than elation, since he'd come to undersatnd that the human spirit is too restive for true fulfillment and 
long-living happiness, or some debuached reality of pleasure, since he had lived through that form of lifestyle previously in cowardice, and it only left him with a foginess which rebounded 
every other day he led with such impropriety. </p>

<p>With this, he ventured the world in a manner resembling quiet desperation, and at first glance to the membranic outsider, it may have seemed, from the annals of his posture, his more slovelnly display, and the with the chip that he had deliberately placed upon his shoulders for others to view in question, that this desperation was nothing less episodic and silencing than other moods. But, as there were, only he could validate to himself that there was more to his sedation and impassivity than just his undercut lifestyle choices. He knew that this affected him to the roots of character, and although nothing was there to substantiate it in sbolute form, it was a relization he made and was willing to defend against everything the world would put in font of him, he knew he was different.
</p>


<p>While this description of a specific archetype may be skewed as a little personal (crafting a completely new figure in the stitch of imagination is no easy task, especially in the boxed setting of uneven and impromptu writing), it is not hard to imagine that this is how untreated minds are disposed to fall into, when everything else is failing. It becomes simple, after realizing that everything you've been told about life and the most befitting way to live for all individuals who wish to grow themselves is written and handled by hands steeped in bad conditioning, to think of people as plain objects, who either take or give from you. Yes, after a while, it gets tiring. Personhood, once thought colorful and vibrant, is lost to a monochrome assessment of their worth. And from what I can tell, what I have endured, I hate the way the world functions and the nerve that some individuals, of no proper origin, have in offering guidence to the truly unique and insigtful. 
</p>


<p>But it's the shit that people are interested in, I suppose. Come to think of it, the only thing that goes underrated and undermentioned in a world of aggrandizement is... simple talent. Honest interest. And that shouldn't have to be sought out in a candidate position, or even in an employee. That should be brought out in a person who is fit for leading and advancing the way of other intellectual minds. Everyone else who contributes to our ongoing structure.. well.. they're just there. Nothing special to note about them. And yet they're the ones who prescribe for the mind. They're the ones who offer their keen advice on how to 'fix' people's lives.</p>                                        

<p>I'll conclude this entry, which puts tautology to special use, by rehasing the same blanket statement I find myself repeating in my head multiple times throughout the boring 7:00am-2:00pm workweek that I find myself accustomed to, and that is,</p>
