				  <div class="main-component-item"><p>In some crude way, out of some weird afflatus, I've come to recognize that my little blog here might be an expressive way to cope with and taming thoughts, and find the right personalized approach to deal with the fatigue and toils of the mind, which likes to hector and scream at itself irrationally. </p>

<p>Essentially, maturity is all about keeping sane, but to a level that's more consistent and informed than what's observed in one's younger years. Strictly speaking, this blog is not a form of personal development, it is rather a documentation of how I have matured across time, what steps I took, and what the consequence of my actions was against the greater whole. </p>

<p>The reason why a matured figure is depicted as 'sapped' serves as a basis for this characterization: if impulsivity is mainly gated by excessive energy, then reducing overall activity (say, by making one feel fatigued) will produce symptomology of an advancing stage of maturity. What may come as laziness of mind starts with the facial expression of a man open to new ideas, willing to ponder about them and speak his mind only when he has recognized something vital to the conversation at hand. Of course, that's not the definition of what a wise pause of silence may be, but it is an exact interpretation that anyone who has rosy expectations of a matured human may arrive at. The less desired effect of reducing these impulsive patterns is understandable, especially for those who have ever felt sedated before. But it's not tiredness drawn by privation, lack of sleep, or any physical factors thereof. It's a certain form of tiredness that you don't happen to feel but realize when contrasting the spirits of a child to a college undergraduate. While the child's attention is displaced into multiple subject areas, causing a loss in the ability to form clear objectives and/or focus towards achieving whatever the child sets to his/her mind, the college graduate is forced either by experience or tension to perform aptly in whatever he is tasked with. The rational extension that age grants to the young adult still, much like other evolutionary traits, has been written quite poorly for the simple fact that it frequently brings overcomplications in life decisions and a fallow close-mindedness in perspective. By age, you begin to think too much about how things are supposed to happen, and during the time of actualization, you are most stern in the perspective of the firmament being a sum of all communal constructs. You're most likely to believe in the value of currency, securement, prosperity, family, things which come out as meaningful primarily from the values that others have continued to place upon you from the first moment of interaction to the last before finding a decent settlement somewhere and embarking on the quest to scale the social latter. Hm. This country is no good. It doesn't expect much reflection on its values, the questioning of why. Plurality in these social constructs is hard to find, mainly because they are all too easily assumed by people who are prone to conforming too easily, which happen to be the majority. No, this isn't me rejecting the idea of success being in anything corporate, but it's me offering a gentle reminder to myself that little is stopping a human from being anything other than a conformist besides the mind itself. It's an interesting idea because it can be used to think of criminals and the lesser peoples of society to not be less than diseased, but demonstrative of a particular type of character that has "matured" in its way. Considering action before committing it likely comes with a very slight, haggard sensation of acceptance. Being unaware or unaffected by the situation at hand may leverage time to make more informed decisions throughout the day, but that comes with its own loss. In my thoughts, I detailed a single form of 'matured' figure, who has entrenched himself into a vastly dull and comfortably sedated state to get through the day. His demeanor shows some impotence which he chooses not to address for his reasons, and his understanding of the world presents him as cynical and misanthropic in an unrelatable, pitiable way. His style in which he chose to live was his own decision, and followed a previous lifestyle of lesser sobriety, although in it he was just as indifferent to the arts and his own personal development as it was the case in this new one.  He did his best to tune out what the world was trying to offer him, which was little at all, and because of the lies that others had led him with, he promised himself he was never going to act out again in a fit of craving and instead worked to achieve a complete suppression of thoughts that commonly took him astray and diverted him away from the path that he believed the was destined for. Interesting how "destiny" is synonymous for most people with validation by reaching a certain point in each of the different areas of their lives. No human was procreated to serve as some mechanical object. If the concept of destiny did hold out to be true, then I can assure you that anything a human was meant to achieve must have roots in the environment.

<p> But I digress. I always digress. Regarding his thoughts as mostly habituated, and realizing that he only had so much time before he had to specialize in the world, he urgently needed a solution that he could practice for the remainder of his time of ambitious youth... before his skin peeled and his eyes strained by having to show to a confined cubicle daily to provide sustenance for himself (since at this time, he met no desire to find a significant other, being as though people to him were mechanical ragdolls who never changed unless by an extreme impulse or intervention of some sort). He was numbed, but also quite determined in leaving behind the hurricane of lies that conditioned him badly at childhood. It wasn't until much later in his life that he became firm in his convictions of how people responded and behaved in their environment, and that he could do little to inform them since most people had a type of penchant or presumed fondness for taking offense at the existence of others' views which had conflicted with their own. There was nothing wrong, he figured, with being this obstinant or intolerant to different viewpoints, since he noticed that pattern to do so even within himself, and began to believe it was a product of nature. However, he came to see the abuses that others' had endured, and their nonchalance to all of this made him furious at the world he was put into without his hearing. He tried to enjoy much of life as possible, without thinking too much about the responsibilities which had taken away precious time from whatever he wanted to do by his lonesome. He felt that these responsibilities were beginning to take more from his life than they were servicing it. (It's easy to think this when the high-and-low ups-and-downs studs found in life are too disorganized, which is far too often the case for most people.) At any given moment in time, this individual was finding himself doing things that he knew he would berate himself for doing later down the line, though they were completely unrelated to the addictive trends that he suppressed (or that suppressed him). Wasting massive hours on the internet, lying around and thinking about an incident from his childhood that had no significance in the now, or, perhaps more frequently, a fragment of dialogue from a conversation that he found himself unwittingly a part of during the earlier happenings of the day. In all fairness, anything from the past could have emerged in his chaotic mind. For him, it was incredibly difficult to focus on the present, and knowing the nature of his thoughts which had destructed his own individual improvement (in these responsibility sectors) over a larger stretch of the term. After much thought, he realized he needed to structure and make habitual a pattern of thinking from which he could, at any moment, return to for the sake of eluding his impulsivity. There were other behavior practices as well, he realized, that may lessen his daily stresses which may succor in a greater attachment to the present. Ensuring adequate sleep hours and cycling, he noted, was a glaringly obvious course that he, or anyone for that matter, could partake to make life just a tad bit more bearable, even if it could not yield anything to his overall performance. And this was it. Really. It was all he ever thought he needed, just the feeling of security rather than pure happiness as he had come to find that the human spirit was too demanding and particular for most of everyone he knew to be entitled to a lifelong vivacity. As nice as it would be, keeping sane was by far more important than working towards fulfillment... who knows what the vicissitudes of life may do to this endless search. </p>

<p> I place a brief lacuna in the interpersonal growth of this individual. Here I would like to underscore "creative destruction" in the coming of a new individual, such as one that looks for a way to sunder his mind from the attachments and trappings in this sad, pathetic place of the world that I happened to be born into. I first came across a historical usage of the phrase "creative destruction" in a page of <i>Why Nations Fail</i>, that discussed the rejection of William Lee's proposal of the stocking frame knitting machine, which had threatened the professions of many peasants/artisans (guilds in European Middles Ages had met concerns with these early forms of Industrialization, and stray from traditional methods came to justify the Luddites) who continued to knit manually, first by Elizabeth I. His proposal was similarly rejected when set in France. I thought of this phrase as yet another hippie term to be read outside of anything relating to developmental psychology. Indeed, after witnessing what it truly embodied in the movie and transcription of Fight Club (a wild masterpiece of neo-noir), I've come to understand that most of what maturity was simply this way of hazing out former ideas and attachments to allow for the growth and regeneration of healthier ones. Quiet desperation is not how I would like my life to end. And while stating this out loud may seem as uncertain as all of the rest of what I've said, it's a fear of missing out that rankles when reflection takes up more time than it should. I can't imagine what it would mean to be, what quietly desperate looks like, but from having been overruled by this hangover-like state for so long, I can say that feeling stable has become so lost as an experience, for whatever reason that this has existential dreading draped in just expressions and sighs of boredom has fallen upon me, I know that feeling like this for the rest of my days is going to be hell on earth. They talk about taking it easy, I'm beginning to think that such is integral and that taking only as much as one can handle, perhaps even a little less, goes underappreciated. Yeah, a little goes a long way. But the will to change has to be so determined... and I'm guessing it only comes with exposure and reflection. That, however, presents a dilemma: if under reflection you find that you take enjoyment in thinking too much about your problems, and this tendency to think in excess is embedded as a trait that you have not developed but rather let live by its own since birth, how do you go about repressing it... and does it become something that you actively seek to repress if doing such only brings more frustration than necessary? Thinking about it, this region of doubt is the literal edge of where you either come to define yourself based on your own standards or by conventions conceived elsewhere. In essence, the matter may be reduced to the following: if a perception of something bad (thinking) leads to something worse over time (frustration from future shortcomings in repressing thought), then would it be better to identify thought as something not inimical, but only a part of one's nature? Some comedians like Doug Stanhope take the position that those capable of taming thoughts and utilizing them as they appear in undue proportion, are better off than the inbreds of society. I find comfort in that idea, but even the simplest thoughts that come in abundance make the simple monotonous task of reading from a school textbook (at times) the most difficult task to be tasked with. Maybe there's a healthy balance? For those hopeful enough, maybe there exists a very exacting nuance between free thought and dedicated attention that does not demand the simple use of clinical medicine to appease these attention-deficit symptoms. I'm not one to write about CBT or any form of therapeutic services that distance from the use of simple medicines to treat disordered mental states (or, to construct states that those seeking relief would like to experience). Interestingly enough, both happen in concert with one another and fulfill the service of creative destruction as it happens to be with the secondary roots of character (that is, the adjustment of thoughts and behaviors in response to stimuli). In clarifying this point, the experience of an erratic thought occurring in the forefront part of the mind that diverts focus from a particular material of study could be soothed by encouraging a particular response to something that happens. I take pride in terming this exit from the emotional state of one's mind, the fragment that happens to bring out the most intense of life's experiences to something more outward-looking as a special form of transcendence: the assumption of a "psychologist's perspective". It really leads me to wonder how psychologists had managed to overcome their hurdles.. since psychology is based on nothing empirical and treatments are indeterminant. The branch is a pseudoscience. But I guess that most people, who face problems distinct from what's objectively seen as a disorder of the natural state are curiously attracted to these treatment varieties in hopes to attain this overseeing state. Maybe it's not a common creed, but I believe that this semi-divine way of controlling the human that's in all conscious lifeforms by generalizing maps of behavior is not a bad way to add some order into one's mental atmosphere.</p>

<p>
In light of this topic, I still haven't made explicitly clear how I feel about treatment. The thing about stimulant ("speed", as it is known in the underground) treatments is that they work for everyone. They're not selective treatments, they grant everyone who uses them some additional taste of clarity and focus... but what might it do in putting away thought? Alertness and focus are different states entirely, but the composure of the mind... there's no clinical term that comes to mind easily to designate its character. I always feel doubtful about comorbid treatment options, if that contextualization of the term fits here. I'm after clarity and wordlessness, not an induced, artificial state of "being present," as I have talked about earlier. 
</p>

While a pint of indifference is crucial to make sure that whatever that you're following is followed for the right reasons, accepting it is a slippery slope, in the case of a massive realignment of ideas. Being dissatisfied with how the environment is does nothing to relieve one's mind from the turmoil that comes with understanding the absolute need to break away and start developing a separate identity for one's own. Quiet desperation, on its own, also just looks to be feverish and ill. Just think of what it means for a man capable of going along with a personality outline for him to go along with for adding order to his zaniness. From the annals of the posture of a quietly desperate man, from his more slovenly display, and grimness of his gait, long face... and not to mention that undiscoverable chip...  But, as there were, only he could choose to forfeit the challenges of life and continue walking unrealized or at least seek some footing. It's never a clear choice, but it was hard to find fault with the idea that his behavior was affecting him even to the roots of his character. And, while this may be skewed as a little personal (crafting a completely new figure in the stitch of imagination is no easy task, especially in the boxed setting of uneven and impromptu writing), it is not hard to imagine that this is how untreated minds are disposed to fall into when the world around them begins to tumble. It becomes simple, after realizing that everything you've been told about life and the most actionable way to live for all individuals who wish to grow themselves is written and handled by hands steeped perversion, to think of people as plain objects, who either take or give from you. Yes, after a while, it gets tiring. Personhood, once thought colorful and vibrant, is lost to a monochrome assessment of their worth in a factory-like setting. And from what I can tell, what I have endured, I hate the way the world functions and the nerve that some individuals, of no proper origin, have in offering guidance to those the gifted.  </p>


<p>
Simple talent and honest interest, though by far the best qualities to see in an individual, has trimmed... And that shouldn't have to be sought out in a candidate position, or even in an employee. That should be brought out in a person who is fit for leading and advancing the way of other intellectual minds, or leading themselves. Everyone else who contributes to our ongoing structure.. well.. they're just there. Nothing special to note about them. And yet they're the ones who prescribe for the mind activities, medicines, directions, facts. This place is disgusting. Everything's fake. The only truth that the world brings is one's ability to figure things out for themselves.
