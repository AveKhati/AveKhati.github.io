				  <div class="main-component-item"><p>This is a short entry that does not place much of an emphasis on prevaricative workaround to gain quantity in writing. This is one strictly about quality.
It's no longer about the thoughts that I incurr during the process of my writing, but something that I feel indebted to let the world in on... because this is 
heavy and it's worth sharing. This is a little paragraph that speaks of how much perspective can change, and the will to pay back dues.</p>

<p>I've come to realize that there is no single-handed panacea for dealing with productivity issues. Restless minds are wonderful, and it is a shame that they have to deal with the putrid holds of public education. It shouldn't be confined for hours on end under the same colorless environment if it was designed for exploration. Unfortunately society is of bedlam and helplessness, and there's little students can do, besides criticize our teachers and guidence councilers, deans and educators, for doing their jobs while selling themselves out to a system so fragile and.. just.. laughable. I'm not disordered. I'm just clearer than you are. </p>

<p>The only way out of this, simply, is to appreciate the gift, and strive to express it into action.</p>

<p>The post about the world history exam I had published earlier tells of strain that came from not wanting to do something boring and mandated by the forces that be. Looking back at it, the only installed purpose there is for anything I will be doing in order to build upon my chances of proficency on the AP: World History exam that is slowly looming the tide of time... is a casted resentment that I direct to anyone who has ever talked to me about academic matters without a proper care for coursework... and a newly found respect for my history teacher. He shows up every day, and pushes through the grimness of a vast array of uninterested, dour adolescent faces, neatly ordered in rows from the front of the calssroom board to the back wall. He gets through it. He's made a life for himself, and he doesn't judge. He doesn't seek to motivate students, but he teaches the material exceptionally well. He assigns ample work to remember and get done, but he never adivses us on how to do it. It's beautiful. And for that, I guess I'll just have to secure a five just for him... </p>

<p>not for anyone else, though. Not even for myself. The rest of society can leave to my own device. Bunch of inbred swines you guys continue to be. Pathetic. </p>
