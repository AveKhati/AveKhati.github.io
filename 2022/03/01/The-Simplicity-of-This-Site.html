Nothing besides the words on the page is worth viewing, and other aspects of the sight, no matter how attractive or pandering they seem, may go omitted if they serve little to no purpose in the greater part of expressing myself and my struggles through ordinary pixels. In this I mean to tell you that I'm a complete novice at webdevelopment, and scowered the most basic of resources I could find to make a site that would be as minimally appealing as possible, choosing to put special emphasis on the deliverance of my ideas instead. Nothing besides bootstrap was used for the navbar. The nav items and the index frames were formatted using a flexbox. That's it. There's nothing more that needs to be added for appeal, since information is the only thing that should matter. In fact, a similar philosophy of design was vocated by the respectable Paul Gharam in development of the site <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com" class="primary">hackernews</a>. If I can recall, I think somewhere in the site Paul gave his idea on why hackernews looks the way it does. If you want to expand your mind, I suggest you go and find it and read the article thoroughly- most of Paul's writings are short, and that's why I take interest to him. I can apprecaite a site like hackernews that does not lure with color and protruding graphics, or require the reader to have to fill out a forum and disable his adblocker, to get to the root of what the site has to offer (which is most times either entertainment or information). I find truth in writing. Pure writing. My penmanship is not of the best form and typing is the most neatly efficient way of communicating information, as well as bringing new information to light.

Maybe all of this is too needlessly symbolic, but I feel I am, although sometimes very faulty in understanding myself, in power to commiserate anyone who shares attentiveness problems as I do... who deals with hyperactive ("racing") thoughts for most of the day as I do... I find that keeping the number of distractions that spans the surface of the medium (in which <strong>any</strong> information is let out) as low as possible helps get me to focus. I find it hard to concentrate on the center of the page if there are banners of flickering advertisements surrounding the center of focus. If it ever comes to the point where a change of theme is pardoned for this site, I still would like to retain simplicity in the way the information is expressed, although it comes to my attention that sometimes my writing can't help itself. I see it as just another thing to work on, but I uphold the promises of never putting down the dignity of a <i>reader who reads for the sole purpose of reading.</i> But... I'd say that the growth of this webpage will never come to a point where
