And so the project begins, with a few introductory words and a slew of thoughts that begin to jolt from my mind, which fashion themselves into their independent sentences. Those sentences become keystrokes, and eventually, the writer, which is I, gains something to his benefit - my ideas are finally written into permanence. Most of what I will be writing will follow no strict order, it will flow by crude and natural chemistry. There will be no total revision of ideas, although structural and orthographic changes may be considered. As I continue to type these words on my computer screen, in a blackened text editor that has no embedded plugins or third-party streams, I continue to experience what I have always experienced.. great fatigue and a running rivulet of thoughts which I have time and time again tried to suppress and reprove. They never go away, and unfortunately, I'm past the age by which any form of consultation is said to resolve the problem entirely. All I have now is this opportunity to write for eyes who will read these fables for assessment only, which is a true shame considering the great complexity of the mind. If you are ever inclined to speak concerning any of the ideas which happen to fall into this growing canvas, feel free to reach out to me: sublimeavis@gmail.com, such would be appreciated even by myself, given how hefty the effect of solitude is to the inexperienced mind.

The first thing I would like to address in greater detail has been already written above, it's my inexplicable inability to focus my thoughts on any specific task which I am doing, or any lesioning of the mind that needs greater focusing. At any waking interval, most parts of my collective consciousness are running, and I don't get much of a say in how these parts operate, what they think, how they affect me. Because of this, I've come to question the idea of free will given that all we are is a palpable product of chemicals, reducible to the smallest of things that humans have imagined. That's not necessarily something to cherish, but that is a discussion topic for another episode. In the psychological literature, they term excessive and uncontrolled thinking things like "rumination", "perseveration", and (perhaps more familiar) "obsession". As far as I may be concerned while writing this, there is no suitable way to manage these symptoms, I think it's fair game to assume that these expressions are immanent within a subset of characterisms and personhoods, there really is no way to change one's identity without killing it whole and building another from scratch(heh, I think I quoted Fight Club there!).. but for some reason or another, humans can accept that possibility for what it is... and seek palliative measures to 'cope' rather than reform. Neurology cannot change itself. </p>

In a way, I suppose this rapid typing is a form of coping, but I will only type for so long before I pursue something else, and I will only do that other thing before forgoing it for another... then the cycle continues. The mind that I was given is a weird one, it's labile and maladaptive, there's no dispute on that front. The mind that I have been granted has led me to do things that I sheepishly regret doing sometimes, speaking things that came to the frustration of others, even though it was intended for comic relief. No matter how badly I was reprimanded by someone of "authority" (doesn't exist, by the way, we're all human, we're all carnal to the core, we're all purposeless), however, I still felt some form of frustration energy that I could never express in words. Today, I speak of it as content or shallow bitterness for the world, the world that doesn't understand me and my ambitions. I was brought up in the 21st century, the music here is terrible, punk and grunge are dead. Experience is far facile. Everything I've ever been told is a lie. Everyone here lives virtually similar lives, they're no good and enriched with an invaluable ego. They speak and breed off the words of others, they follow norms blind as sheep. They're all able to place themselves comfortably down in uncomfortable desks for hours on end. They enclose themselves to a social circle of morons to simplify their lives. False wisdom in adages that vocalize in my mind, frequencies that I can't escape, frequencies that don't even exist. Who framed education in the first place, anyway? I'm no good at task switching, since these patterns of task bracketing flicker. The effect is similar to the lights of a house if its governing generator switches had been pressed blindly by a man succumbed in absolute darkness. Perhaps in the middle of a storm? Ah, I need to rework that delivery; analogies have never been my forte. Nothing really has, actually.</p>

And that brings me to my next topic, that I'm "worst at what I do best" ("Smells Like Teen Spirit", Nirvana) and in a way, that's a blessing, since I can at least have some experiences kept to myself. Kurt may have agreed with this, as the following verse goes something like, "and for this gift, I feel blessed". What a masterpiece of a song. Referring back to the point, however, I just haven't been able to pinpoint anything that I am drawn to or anything that I have the willingness to develop a preexisting talent in. I guess for others my age, that is acceptable since we've only seen so much of the world. Perhaps now you're understanding how this site is ordered... or perhaps how much of a disarrayed mess it will soon roll into... not much of a writer either, as is evidenced here. Ah, my initial idea for this site was a collection of meaningful poems and serenades, but now it has already transfigured into a sappy and meaningless collection of everything I've been thinking of for the entirety of my teenage years, from the moment I realized that everything that works for people works only for everyone else, and my elevated problems can't be helped. And since we humans are nothing more than a polity of problems and experiences, my entire being cannot be helped. In the words of an already maddened man, "I can't be helped!" Of course this mad man enjoys his own conscious maiming (as I sometimes do) perhaps with a greater masochistic pride but also a commendably feral animalistic appetite to bring about daring ripples and grave disturbances in the restful waters of peace. In this comparison, I have mentioned my idea of madness, a key trait that can be found in all humans who have ever ideated disrupting the stable dynamics of the natural world. Ah, how we love to take for ourselves. It's so easy to loathe the qualities that typify man, and it's easier to be badly conditioned into thinking otherwise. This is especially unfortunate since what must follow is the undertaking of one's own recognization and cleansing. After one has realized the capacity of the treacherous human being, they follow the process of atoning arrogance of thinking all is well for the genteel and reformed product of bloodstained evolution which we have come to label as "humankind." Huh, how did I get swayed into speaking of man's psychedelic madness from the discussion of my best qualities being others' worst? Well, I suppose these two ideas aren't that far distant from one another. The fact remains, notwithstanding his being the most diversified writing I've bothered to write in a while, that I am honestly a depressing figure. However repeated or trite that may strike you now, I can honestly say that I'm not sure if I have tried if I had placed myself under enough struggle to grow myself. I can, with respectable humility, state that I have had a father who provided and nurtured me throughout my youthful years. At present, as he has been, I find myself bemoaning at times how I have yet to come under the wing of a father figure that has educated me much on lessons oriented towards framing a man's mind to adapting best into whatever field he chooses. I have never conversed fully with an experienced man, aside from what simple conversation had to offer, about the trappings of honorable and dutiful living. Over time, I've come to realize that my own separation from all common forms of religion and ethics which normally transfer through an advanced filial relationship with a dedicated father figure has helped me massively in creating my own opinions about the nature of life and the environment that surrounds me.  But I'm unsure what to think about those matters, whether they have serviced me in a helpful light or just the opposite.</p>
