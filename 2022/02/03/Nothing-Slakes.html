I remember writing back, perhaps a couple of months ago, another entry of namesake... knowing full well what dissatisfaction tasted like since I could hardly express my ideas without putting them behind complex wording and grammatical loss. Even then, if I can verifiably remember how I was feeling all that while ago, I realized that I was deficient in a great many things. I always felt close to being productive, but there was just a trace amount of <span class="lead">idleness</span> in my mind for everything that I participated in, and I could not put it into words or express in any way what I was feeling. And, you know, it was an interesting, almost sensational feeling within my skull which I tried to rack out of its ungainly way of approaching and doing things, but I think I lost it somewhere along the way. I think it was around the time when I realized that the experience I felt could not be changed no matter how hard I tried. I looked around the classroom one day, and there they were. Many kids were dutifully attending to their papers. I peered past my left shoulder to this one student and I realized that no amount of eye-straining could get this worker bee of its course to reciprocate a glance. Growing a little disaffectionate to how the universe was treating me, I probed each and every person around me, but I could not get a gesture back from anyone in any form in which I was hoping for... they had all left the room in a way to someplace else... someplace that I couldn't get to. I just kept sitting, docile as any <span class="pl-2 pr-2 custom-span-profile rounded-pill">IB</span> student should be, trying to get focused on my work, but memories that I wish hadn't returned came back to me with no intermediary. I asked myself, this time around a little more discontented with how the universe was treating me, whether this is who I had turned into, and what I will be for the next few years of my life (if not longer). I did not get any work done that day, I simply went home and did whatever else I had in mind; during the same week, I wrote one of my earliest blog entries about the tides of this thing that we define as focus. Never being in the "present moment," something that I felt was so evocatively worded that I had begun to believe, with what I thought was sound reasoning, that everyone besides me would have been able to achieve this mental state without the utmost use of effort. Eventually, I'd realize that such is not the case for vast many people who try to find a solution to their grief. Mine was my own. I searched erratically for days and days for an answer, for any pill that might finally shut my mind the hell up, but nothing surfaced. Medicine to the mind is subjective, and some people's problems are just not able to be easily solved. I've come to believe that to be only natural. Cruel, but natural, as most things are. In this vast, ever-expanding universe, one persons' problems are not worth all the sacrifices for others, and entitled people such as me should learn to accept that to be the case. The best thing we can do to help ourselves teether and tumble out of the ensnaring grasp of narrow-mindedness, at least what had worked for me, was to think more abstractly to minimize the problems that burdened us.

There's no word to describe what this particular problem is. It's not just mere distractability, since distractibility is a key human trait that was necessitated for the survival of our species. The dynamic landscape demanded a mind capable of processing, even with just partial attention, whatever skulked in the surrounding foliage, whatever caused the ruffling beside the trees, whomever's voice it was that was seemingly calling a tribal rally, and a host of other possible occurrences that happened in our periphery. Evolution is amazing, and I can esteem it as one of the most beautiful things about the cycles of the world we inhabit, but it had caused us some drawbacks whenever humans came up with professions, whenever they demanded labor from the first indentured servant or serf. What's more is that it is the biggest problem now, in an age predicated on the pillars of professionalism and experience-holding. Our most beautiful traits are what come back to disrupt us, and we have only come to reprimand them because of the simple fact that we called for an environment that doesn't allow for it to grow. A distracted mind is beautiful because it is fluid. The lack of attention we bring to any one thing, in particular, allows for us to grant a larger overall focus on everything. A distracted mind is capable of forgoing fine detail in its drawings in order to render a painting that essentially becomes an image of the world more lucid than it is physical. That's the beauty of the mind that probes everything around it, a mind that can't be bothered to get fixated on any one task because it had deeper interests than to fulfill anyone particular thing. Being distracted almost always leads to impulsivity in one way or another. There's no direct cause for it, but I can attest to that shallow fact of life. The "condition" that I have is nothing more than a way to see the world, it is not something that should be admonished to do any differently because genetics picks a favor and the conscious mind only rides the pulsing tides that the mind creates. Those like us, distractable and carefree, may not always be able to enjoy the company of our mind, but we are able to lie there and watch from afar as all of those darting fish rock the confines of our mind. It's not a sightly scene, but it is one that can easily grasp your conscious mind. It's all in the head, as everything has always been, and this character of mind does not draw anything away from that understanding whatsoever. There's reason to get upset when bearing one of these disordered minds, but there is a reason for anyone to lose themselves since there's always that one desirable or undesirable trait that people seek out and consign their souls to whomever to try to exchange. There's always a reason for anyone to go insane, whether it be pure blandness, stupidity, extreme lack of openness, incorrigibility of some form... there's always something that can drive someone to peak insanity. And that's a factor of being in a human vessel in the 21st century, where everything besides biology continues to involve at a pace we cannot possibly understand even for ourselves. The greatest of all ironies is that we've lost perspective. The compelling force of what drives a worker to his workplace in full understanding that he is to provide hours of his day giving whatever he can produce to a higher authority in power which will reimburse in some petty remuneration him with a chance to steady or improve his standard of living is biology itself. Grieving desperation for status pulls people to do things that seem impractical on paper until it becomes the norm, and everyone who may fall out of line is derided and put down for being too lazy or purposeless. I understand that this is coming to sound borderline spiritual, but that's mainly because of the connotations associated with 'mind,' which lent themselves to a few charlatan gurus who became well recognized for their self-help books. Funny. Anyway, the diverted mind is capable of seeing these patterns, but it comes along creating its own struggles when the environment around is growing out of proportion to what's natural. A mind keen on seeing the world in its entirety, when being sat stationary for hours on end, begins to practice fixation on aspects of the environment irrelevant to... whatever it is being taught. It starts to gain sensitivity to things such as mockery, a form of art, and can grow neurotically attached to an insult or even the person who hurled it for some reason another. It gains experiences and memories that were better off left as a part of history, but unfortunately, they become ingrained along with the cornerstones of a diverted mind, ready to run its errands on the hapless victim bearing the diverted mind for many years to come.

So we medicate. We take speed. We take Adderall. We take Ritalin. We dose caffeine pills, one after the other, and they don't make us frantic. They help our visions narrow. They take away the diversion and bring something in its place - alertness. We become like everyone else, just for a few brief moments, but damn, they're worth it. We do anything that might help in keeping the lifeless beasts at bay, at least for whatever time we can spare for ourselves. Go easy on us. <mark>We are the music makers. We are the dreamers of dreams. Our diverted traits are what give birth to the arts. But sometimes we struggle because of them.</mark> And we were born this way, animate and restless, at the right place but at the not much so the right time. We're discouraged, sometimes by ourselves, but we're not hopeless. We're willing, but it gets rough for us, not for any reason other than genetics.

Let me speak for myself here now, and this is not to brush off as entitled, lost, or mortified in any way, but the winding road of self-doubt and frequent perspective-shifting leaves me no one to talk to other than myself. <span class="custom-highlighted-portion">The road I walk on is lonely, and since childhood, it has been the only one in which I have ever known.</span> Sometimes I would dilate my gaze outside of the backseat windows of the car, devising some extreme fantasy that caused me to drop whatever it was I was holding in my hands too many times to count. <span class="custom-highlighted-portion">I don't know where this road will lead me, but I call it home, since it is the only way I go, and I walk it alone.</span> Don't give me clemency. Don't offer me any quantity of respect that I am not deservant of. Just be considerate to me, and that's all I ask of whoever reads this, for you will never be able to relate to what it is I am. And that's okay. Leave me be.
