It's already fairly late in the afternoon, and I've got something to write about today. I don't know whether to be pleased, since I'm indebted to much homework and farewell assignments that writing something on this page may only continue to cut down my sleeping hours. As the days go on, and a large quantity of haze accumulates in my mind, I can say that I'm starting to fear that conviction. Keeping pages brief while boxed-in on time may help to practice succinctness, but it's the dearth of usable information in this large heap of blind ranting that keeps me afloat. This style of writing, though it goes by many names, fits me best, and that's not to further belittle myself as a hackful and garrulous writer who speaks much with little to say, although I am. 
</p>


<p>This style of writing is mainly adopted to get the majority of my thoughts into paper; diversion brings about too many reactions to the world outside, and when some realizations become as noteworthy (not necessarily for good), I feel compelled to represent them through text. And so I type, I type fairly fast, through all my thoughts, and as I pass by, I get such a relief knowing that on paper, these thoughts don't seem petrifying. They resemble the ordinary, day-to-day problems of most people I've come across, who all share their hardships within their conscious experience. But I'm still best left alone, without the opportunity to bother others, since then I can compose my free spirit a little better. However, there is, although grim as can be accepted, little to for managing initial thoughts (I know I mentioned this idea several times in my earlier entries, but I speak of problems from the present scope, and the occurrence of these complaints speckled throughout the entirety of the site, I hope, comes to show how significant of an issue this has become for me.</p>

<p>
There are few remedies, but looking away from the usage of medicine for a time, it's just a bore to watch the mind outstrip rational judgment in pursuit of less agreeable ends, to know that we are just conflicted in ourselves, that this impersonal confliction is what defines the human being more than evolutionary services that gave us form. No matter how capable we are, and how much we like to believe in potentiality, remembering ourselves as the emaculated specs of egotistical wonder brings everything back into its regular life, that is, it's own standing with the universe. Ah, I even repeated that expression a few times before. I guess it's just bewildering enough and was the closest into terms that I was able to get an idea out of my head. Indeed, thinking back on it, this gestalt way of seeing how everything was ordered was a bit of an indulgence a few months ago. Maybe it would have been possible to order a physical tabloid describing the dense interplays between these drastically different systems of thinking that I so regularly experience. I wouldn't suggest anyone read it, of course, for reasons similar to why I, myself, feel dispassionately pleased with most of my work. I find myself refusing to review whatever it is I have written because of an obscure resentment that I can't classify, though I feel it gravitating more towards how I write out my ideas (here I'd like to take special note of verbiage, grammatical disorder, and the disparity between the inception of the idea and its lackadaisical written, representative counterpart). At least for what it is worth, writing most of these strings of slurred speech - although very aimless and imprecise at times - brings some relief in knowing that at least some of the ideas which I am occasionally confronted with. 
</p>

<p>Apart from ideas, though, at least this blog can be my outlet for detailing life's problems. It may not help in resolving most of them, but writing here, on the site of my creation, is simply enjoyable. It does not require me feeling any way, in particular, to forget that this little project, which has quickly matured into something with a greater role than just to fulfill an IB graduation requirement, will always be waiting for me, in the best and worst of times. I can go about explaining why I feel the way I do with this site. I can posit when spectating and speculating the thoughts which occur to me when writing out these entries, that this writing type resembles a dialogue than it does some soliloquy. The person I converse with is myself. Myself and I barter ideas and terminology by which these ideas can go best expressed. But during the transactions, there exist moments where myself and I look above from our hands, which we for the time have relegated to the simple use of rekindling faded ideas, and into each others' eyes. What we see is a reflection of ourselves, everything we're composed of, and it's surreal. We watch, with longing, disgruntlement, and absolute wonder as the dynamics of the human spirit circulate around in a course of order no less foreseeable than the accidental dropping of a half-opened burlap sack of marbles. We watch as these ineffable traits roll together in the same way as clashing marbles usually do. Our movements parallel each other. I am the only one to who I can relate, and I and he can openly discuss our experiences whenever I chose to sit down in front of this blank monitor, ready to leave the world for a good while. Sweet dreams. </p>
