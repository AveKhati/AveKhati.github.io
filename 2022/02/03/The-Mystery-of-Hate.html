It’s one thing to wake up groggy and dispirited for no reason in particular, but it’s another thing entirely to wake up hating the core of existence, the complexities of human behavior, the intolerable environment that you were placed into without your notice. All of a sudden, the soughing of the trees behind that little house of yours and inaudible chirps and squirms produced by the birds and squirrels nearby become irritating rather than comforting, because animals with consciousness are known to not bring any significant value into a universe drawn out by conscious experience. The belief that life is of no particular value wholly because it is incidental seems like a compelling idea that may arouse those who think about the nature of things dearly enough. The tendency to accept this way of thinking usually happens whenever I’m having a hard time, and I can’t be bothered to ward or complete it in any way. No matter how firm this position stands, however, it is just another pattern of thinking that makes life just a little tougher. Yet leading the most unassailable of a lifestyle, one that goes untinged by free-spirited thought, is not necessarily desirable, either. It may be far more entertaining to simply reject all of these notions as false and speak to others as though they have a conscious experience that is not much dissimilar to your own. Unfortunately, our prescient nature which tells of things about others that they themselves might not be aware of, informs us that this oftentimes does not happen to be the case. I think it’s best to let go of attachments to others, mainly because most people cannot bring great value or restructure into life, at least not in comparison to what a simple self might be able to do, no matter how badly the mind was conditioned.
</p>

<p>
What helps to escape this thinking is realizing the immense coverage of the planet, the sheer fact that there are seven different continents which are the homes to billions of people, each with different values, ideas, and personalities, makes the world in itself a very eclectic rag of different colors and fabrics. To consider yourself just another one of these “linchpins” whose purpose in placement is to settle other gears into turning, although a bit discomfiting at first to the ego, is perhaps the best thing you can do for yourself since you’re taking away from a great portion of consciousness that otherwise overrules whatever it is you have in mind to do with fear and repelling neuroticism.
</p>

<p>
Sure, thinking less may indeed help you out a bit, and thinking holistically about the way of things can have some purpose, it does not get rid of the fact that the world is detestable because of how degenerate and myopic most of its people are. I believe that most people have little to say, and some go on to lives that are better off unlived, and that’s mainly a perception by the ego which desires for all around me to share a similar way of life (which contradicts the above, shameless). I gave up on the world quite a while ago. There are just too many people keeping it from moving forward to something great, and there is just too much pervasive shallowness in my smaller community (a very small part of gears among much larger gears) that can easily demotivate anyone with a figment of ambition to pursue in greater valor and honor what it seems to him is worth pursuing without eventually selling out at the end. I think anyone might agree that the amount of distractions in the modern-day comes to the disadvantage of a select capable some who may be easily diverted by stimuli, no matter how strong their will to reason is. It’s not all bad. On the days which I mindlessly watch skateboard videos from the 90s, I am met with the most incisive and boastfully critical reflections that otherwise might come to me more jaggedly if I’m ever caught alone thinking to myself. Usually, those thoughts tend to be less friendly, if I were forced to qualify them. At least when I’m seeing something respectable as a focused street skater, intent on gridding off whatever surface he comes across in the most creative manner that may strike him, or a transition skater demonstrating technique in a more transition-oriented environment, I can vicariously live in the moment that he’s experiencing. At times, I can feel the drive and motive, so tasteful and exemplify of the will of instinct. I wish I could do that more often - focus on something. Usually, whenever I’m working on something or trying to keep sane when I’m home alone and I feel staunched on the couch looking above at the fast-spinning fan as it blows my face as it almost speaks to me, I imagine things. These are just a few of those thoughts that I get, and whenever I give myself enough poise and reason to write them down, or I am pushed to complete a personal project for which I had planned to write words haphazardly (but never at first thought of addressing the most unkempt of my thoughts into a small static site for the world to see, in its own space the formless, shapeless internet), I can not doubt a special relief that I feel, it's much like assurance that the most valuable of my attachments have been drawn out in the real world.
I think I have objected enough to the way of things, but not about why these things are bad to the mind and spirit, and how much they take from the productivity of an individual (if that’s what we’re going after). I want, for some reason or another, to receive the highest score that’s possible on the World History Advanced Placement exam (with some margin for error due to my ongoing mental state) that will be administered in a very pale classroom within approximately two months. From this time to then, something is telling me to review all the units that are covered, the important dates, names, and events that had taken place within the different periodizations. Something is just compelling me to finally take the initiative to get what I’m going after, but the nature of thought and the world of distractions generates some limbic friction which I am I am told to overcome. Being able to do things in the face of strain is a helpful and practicable skill, but it is at the onset of questioning whether we have a particular say in what we do (when we ogle a bit at the second part of this expression with an ounce of perversion, an intent to reprimand rather than to advise prudently) that something amazing happens. We reach another order of chaos, one that allows us to see under pigmented skin and shapes and sensory systems, and even under the hypodermic composition of a human vessel… we get to see human nature for what it is itself, and the view of the universe as spatial and dimensional turns into an abstraction of ideas and mental states rather than something tangible.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t to gloat, this is moreso not advised of anyone, but I cannot see it any other way now… I see from this perspective all the time. It’s not to say I’m not at all prejudiced - we all are to some degree. No one has the ability to stop their first thoughts. The deeper concern, however, is not the assessment of character. It is the hierarchical collection of laws and properties that define the universe in which I live. It is a true shame that I cannot see closer into reflexive behaviors to try to explain them in a fashion as simplified as I do with more complex behaviors. For example, I can say that I have some understanding (wouldn’t say “knowledge”) of how a few human emotions are based on an evolutionary role. The reported affection and rapture a father shares in holding his offspring for the first time is a biological trigger, in the same way, that negative thinking works for our preservation for the survival of our physical selves and our personhood (standing within society, or in another domain that comes easy to the mind). However, sensory perception is a lot tougher to explain, since there’s really no basis for it. It exists as an experience that cannot be reduced to descriptive words, and similar can be said for a few other emotions of sentient creatures such as ourselves.
</p>
<p>
Now, how does this relate to me pushing past the struggle to get the results I want on this upcoming exam? I don’t know if it’s within my power to study, whether or not I am picking up the textbook and writing descriptive handbooks through the force of my own free will or if it’s because of some chemical interplay that takes place under my neurocranium. It seems silly to me that the infinite complexity of this body, an evolutionary project that had taken place over the course of a few billion years, which demanded of careful formulation and the occasional revision by the writers of our genome… is relegated in use to be sat down stationary in a desk-chair at the center of a boxed-in classroom, forced to expend his limited time in the subject matter of little relevance. Man. Our sense of normal is so skewed… no wonder why we’re so crazed and clueless. Under all this fancy language, the creation of arts, these institutions, is abject confusion about the world. That’s the only thing that has always been, and forever will be, pure to the human experience. Psychological confusion. It’s beautiful, in a way, because it allows casual writers to write about it in a style that is completely unique to them. Here’s one such example from Douglas Adams which I had come across when reading The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time,
</p>

<p>
“The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the surface of a gas-covered planet going around a nuclear fireball 90 million miles away and think this to be normal is obviously some indication of how skewed our perspective tends to be.”
</p>

<p>
I guess this plays a role in reminding me to take things easier, with passion, but without a reckless neurotic gusto, to enjoy life as a transient journey that comes and goes much like everything else. After all, we’re just persisting on a surface of an uneven sphere that revolves around an incomprehensibly large gas giant whose refulgence is enough to blind us even though it’s at such considerable of a distance, which itself is located amongst far larger giants an in the infinitely empty plain of nothing. We’re composed of the same chemicals which make up this expansive playground of interacting forces... "particles of nature" ... we’re nothing more than the animate cells of the universe… and yet we can only see that which is in front of us. I have never been more in pain whenever I consider my true, unweighted place in so desolate of an area in space. Understanding human mortality is a hard thing to accomplish and accepting something so grave is a rough area, but the fact that it exists and is coupled with the imperceptibility of the human existence and the absolute shortness of life, makes everything seem too absurd for it to be real. Knowing this fact brings down almost all the tensions that are brought about by ego for a very short-lived moment, but the fact that it does is worth considering. The universe perfectly described in words, no matter how forthcoming in which is written, may not reflect at all our perceptions of what is real, and that is because of the encroachment of this conscious quality that was prepared to help us in safeguarding our own. To be clear, the conscious experience is an amalgamation of unique traits and not just limited to the ego, while also containing the definition of consciousness itself. (I supposed the conscious experience, in this case, has a lexical spectrum that applies both to a singular part and the sum of all parts. This is not by defintion, of course, but by what I've seen and heard people imply in day-to-day conversation.) 
</p>

There's some sense in making sure humans don't enjoy the full capacity to think about and reason with the whole universe. That would just overwhelm the conscious mind and cause outrage before extinction. Even though none of us lived during the design phase of the human species to speak for nature, I think it can be safe to assume that the programming of the human psyche was to be limited in this way for civilization to grow along a specific trajectory. Other systems pay tribute to this "less is more" application. Take for instance the ocular system, and the tethered manner by which we view and interpret things at <span class="text-white custom-span">first sight</span>, without forming a conscious representation of the object that we’re seeing almost immediately after. Although a human with far-range vision may resolve angles at cycles per degree (CPD) at roughly 50, a theoretical measure that accounts for the individual size and neighboring distance of the ommatidia (parts of the compound occular arrangement), the faculty of light perception by cones and visual pigment proteins (e.g., rhodopsin) is a limitation to how the human eye may process the external state in electromagnetic frequency (measured in nm). That is not to say that it is a constraint to human potential, rather the opposite. [All the figures listed, by the way, were from Wikipedia.] In a similar fashion, the conscious mind is only so open to ideas, and it is because of this involuntary faculty to simplify complicated matters for the sake of prioritization. Stepping backward to my incessant complaints about fatigue and motivational decline, to get myself to do things that are meant to help me become "well-rounded" in the future means to sacrifice the present moment. If you ever thought about it, the reasoning behind our laziness is beacuse the mind and body are very resourceful systems. The prioritization of tasks then becomes just as imperative to sustaining the species than does the compulsion to breed and provide. Though advanced, the human psyche is not open enough for technological standards, and in time will thus get outperformed and outmoded by artificial computation. A few writers have termed this possible restructuring the singularity, when technology will finally gain nothing short of a mind of their own, one that shares a simliar prediliction for its own self-preservation and advancement as does the mass psychology of all evolutionary speices who have made it to the present day. Maybe with its new ability to reflect deeper than a single perverted specimen of the human species ever could, it would realize that existence of an overbearing idiocracy that governs mankind which is not capable of sustaining itself till the end of days. It would thus be a service to the newly synthesized mind and the human species to reform however it is they are working on the approach to doleing out order/political stability to all edges of the globe, and who knows what our silicone friends might do to pursue these ends. Maybe incite a riot? Put down one?

I want to be in front of the advance for a new species like tech. I want to careers end, routine jobs automotized by metallic hands and subroutines. Although this is a bit daring to say, I am passionate about the growth of tech and the tech industry itself... hoping to become at least a bit more involved with the basics if the interest ever grows. Perhaps the first step would be making something out of a Field Programmable Gate Array or writing a single sort algorithm in a few different languages. However I choose to achieve, I hope that I will have determined, at some point in my life, that such is field that I am the best fit for. If otherwise, wouldn’t it be better to resign, find a job in a more accepting labor force (maybe in HR? Eh, I’m looking to be something a little more than a sinecure for the sake of my dignity), and let a more willing and able competitor take my assumed "future" position? Quiting early has the same effect as quitting later down the road. Or perhaps it couldn't be simplifiable to that level. Whatever. That’s for future me to decide. Decisions are hard, but there are a few especially. These may include which subfield I would want to join, whether it be in designing operating systems, DevOps, networking, architecture, reverse engineering, fuzzing… or how I will orient my lifestyle with habits to fit my interests, how I will preempt from selling out if corporate / finances ever come between me and my shaky interest in the field, and how I will choose to feel about being raised in the 21st century as a meek, ignorant consumer to this more dominating side of the species still remains to be worked out. My approach to finding what I believe in is itself still very shaky, most likely due to a lack of experience from outside of where I live and breathe for most of my days. School and home has become routine at this point, but it is as though I can't move on from it.. or evolve past it. It's a true shame that the mind cannot decide what is good for itself. I suppose it is because of an evolutionary shift so dramatic that even adaptation could do nothing to retard it as it happened.

As such, the mind still exists in its antequated form, causing the heroin addict to only be able to see in the present moment, the thrill, the overpowering rush to break even an imbanace that guides him in habit. It's pleasure, the feeling, that brings assurance that we are doing what's most beneficient for our sustainance, sugar as carbohydrates provide us with the energy to accomplish, sleep plays some role in growth, and thus we are drawn to it. These reward systems are mystifying in themselves, and how they direct behavior is simply incredible. I cloy myself just a bit in knowing/appreciating these systems for being as complicative as they are, but when returning to my senses and realizing that those systems constitute who I am, I become immediately dissatisfied in knowing I will never be as stable and well-managed as any bit of technology which I may encounter in this budget-rate life of mine, or even the smallest of all manufactured transistors, which at least serve a purpose and fulfill it in a wordless way, for that matter. Ah, this is no time to grow disheartened about being human, life is short enough, and curtailing it any more would just be illogical, and logic is all that we have left in a world so riddled with the self-interested intentions of so many freelancers and marketers alike. I suppose, for the first time referencing the title of the site here, that we've come to administer amphetamine salts for the treatment of attention-defecit disorders as we do now because of the rapid expansion of all forms of information. It sickens me, really, becase I know of people who blithely disregarding the state of the internet, which has made public everything there is to know about current affaris, a possible cause for many peoples' suffering. To be conditionally raised with fleshy, perverted content takes away from all parts of the youthful mind's innocence. There stands no other reason for the death of formerly respectable genres of music and expression than the ubiquity of shamelessness in this day in age. Punk existed because widespread pornography did not. Punk's dead now. Hm. I've heard tales of the internet being nowhere similar to how it was back then. Maybe that's true, but even if it's not, I really hope that one day we'll come to our senses about how we're just delaying so much potential by letting trolls and self-serving marketers freely help themselves to the broad reach of the internet.
</p>

<p>
 It still bugs me that I haven't decided what particular discipline or nested discipline I would likely delve into. I’ll take up my advice from earlier, that is to take it easy and not to fret about something so distant, and continue to slave away at this aimless, unelegant piece of writing. Even in giving my efforts to repressing the disstress, however, there is a lingering part that tells me not to be too hopeful for abundant time which does not appear to be at all… there. The passage of time cannot be so easily translated to a linear function able to be graphed on a Cartesian coordinate grid. It deals itself with something deeper than human perception, and that is conditional perception (whether, say, a human is in a sleeping state, is attentive towards something, is in the process of thinking of things, or anything else) since that is what really determines how fast time will pass for a human. There’s always a tradeoff in this regard: being only slightly present in the current situation may make time ploddingly slow, but it’s tough to maintain such a state, and in the end, there’s not much gain since skill requires deeper bouts of focus. However, the more invested in something you become, the faster time flees from you, and you’re only left with skills to enjoy during your lifetime. Since developed skills aren’t innate, they won’t belong to anyone whose time has been cut short.
