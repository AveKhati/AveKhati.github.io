    <h5 class="card-title">Foreword</h5>
    <p class="card-text">This is my submission for the Personal Project Assignment. I plan on maintaining this site throughout the remainder of my high school years as a way to reflect on recurring struggles and conceived ideas that take up residence, and react strongly whenever I try to evict them, in my head. I view this remote place on the internet as my lodging for these thoughts when they start to infringe on my daily well-being, provocation from my obsessive nature. This is a way for me to relieve myself without expending too much time or resource in some other fashion, like medicine. The only strain that I experience is that which originates from writing out these entries into words, commonly known as the pain of a writer (someone who writes, regardless of cause), and of course, there is always the mild disconcertion that's there whenever throwing off the mask.

<p>
I encourage all readers to proceed with at least a small portion of open-mindedness, possibly allowing for some self-interpretation to flow from what is read and discussed without censuring it blindly. I am available on most occasions, though I only reply to media messages when I'm in the right type of mood, otherwise, I'd rather write my responses to any outgoing messages in a lax and carefree fashion. If you are willing and able enough, contact me at any of the below handles. Additional information about this site, as it pertains to submission and development, can be viewed from the "Project Information" page.
</p>

<br />
For anyone who goes about reading these entries, I am enamored by your tolerance to this joke of a product. I suggest reading from bottom-up, since that is the approximate chronological order in which these posts were composed and publised, and forming your own opinions about whatever it is I have to say about this cruel, unforgiving, merciless, meritless, meretricitous, and maternal world that we live in (not much so the latter, but alliteration rocks). Together.</p>
