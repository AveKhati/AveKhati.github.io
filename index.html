    <p class="card-text">This is my submision for the Personal Project Assignment. I plan on maintaining this site throughout my highschool years as a way to reflect on recurring struggles and conceived ideas which linger on inside my headspace. I view this remote place on the internet as my lodging for my thoughts when they start to infringe on my daily well being, provocation from my obsessive nature. Yes, this is a way for me to relieve myself without destroying myself. The only strain that I expeirence is that which originates from writing out these entries into words, and of course there is always the mild disconcertion that's there whenever putting away the unamused guise.
    <br />
    <br />
     I encourage all readers to procede with a bit of an open mind, allowing some self-interpreation to flow from what is read before censuring blindly. Feel free to contact me at any of my below handles. Additional information about this site, as it pertains to submission, can be viewed from the "Project Information" page. From reading these entries, my best wishes for the reader is for them to look away from the site in acknowledging the pelntitude of perspectives that comes from the conscious mind. I suggest reading from bottom-up, since that is the approximate chronological order in which these posts were composed and publised.</p>
